# 🖥️ Cache Simulator with GUI and Visualization

This project is a **Cache Simulator with GUI and Visualization** that demonstrates how cache memory works in computer systems. It allows users to configure cache parameters such as size, block size, and associativity, and then simulates read and write operations while tracking cache hits and misses. The simulator provides real-time visualization, making it an effective learning tool for understanding cache organization, replacement policies, and performance.

## ✨ Features
- Configure cache size, block size, and associativity
- Perform read and write operations
- Track cache hits and misses
- Real-time visualization of cache state
- Interactive Tkinter-based GUI
- Educational tool for computer architecture concepts

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cache-simulator.git
   cd cache-simulator
````

2. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)*

## ▶️ Usage

Run the application with:

```bash
python main.py
```

A GUI window will open where you can configure cache settings and simulate operations.

## 📊 Example Output

* Shows cache hit/miss statistics
* Visual representation of cache blocks
* Interactive updates during simulation

## 📖 Educational Use

This project is intended for students, educators, and developers to understand the inner workings of cache memory. It can be used in computer architecture courses or as a self-learning tool.
